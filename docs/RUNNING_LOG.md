## Working rules in force

**Two agents in one repo (2026-08-16).** A second agent is building the morphing
sandbox (PLAN 2v) in this same working tree — same filesystem, same branch, one
server on `:5200`. The rules that keep us out of each other's way:

1. **Never `git add -A`.** Stage explicit paths only, or you sweep the other
   agent's half-finished work into your commit.
2. **Owned files are off limits.** 2v owns `score/public/morph.js`,
   `tools/test_morph.js`, `probes/*`, `docs/plans/MORPHING_CHORDS.md`,
   `docs/MORPH_FINDINGS.md`, and the morph panel inside
   `score/public/composer.html`. Read freely, never write.
3. **Shared docs get small targeted appends** (`PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md`,
   `NITS.md`, this file) — never a rewrite of a section you did not author.
4. **Commit your own chunk as soon as it is finished**, so nothing sits
   uncommitted where the other agent might sweep it.
5. **Pushing carries BOTH agents' commits** — it is one repo and one branch.
   Harmless as long as each commit is complete, but it means either agent can
   do the push, and neither should do it without asking.
6. **One server on `:5200`.** Don't start a second — use the one that is
   running. Loading a score in a browser tab makes it that tab's session and
   autosave will write to *that* file, so never open a `piece-*` save just to
   look at something.

## 2026-08-16 · day 10 (Claude Code) — phase shifting

### Session start
- Piece is at **piece-s16 (135.8 s)**; DB3 placed in Messiaen mode 3 on F.
- PLAN 2v Phase 0 (bend probes) came back **passed** — bend is clean to ±200 ¢,
  RPN 0 ignored so the range cannot be widened, and the quartertones patch is
  **not** a uniform +50 ¢ (offset tracks pitch, +23 ¢ at F2 → +57 ¢ at C4).
  That also answers PLAN 2l's blocking question: **bend is the mechanism**.
- Journal §2 is three commits stale (it ends at day 9).

### PHASE01 — the first phase-shift audition
- Composer's spec: two tubas, middle of the range, ~85 BPM, shift to an eighth
  apart over 20 s, hold 10 s, shift back over 20 s.
- Built `tools/phase_shift.js` (parameterized, so the next experiment is a flag)
  → `scores/phase01-8th.json`. **C3 = MIDI 48**, dead centre of `ord` 30–65.
  *Naming trap worth remembering:* the composer's Reaper "F1" = MIDI 41 = F2
  scientific, so this C3 shows as **C2 in Reaper**.
- Model: lane A keeps a strict pulse, lane B plays the same grid displaced by a
  moving offset in BEATS; both lanes emit the same *number* of notes, so they
  are guaranteed back in unison at the end.
- Verified in the running app: loads, lanes 1–2 draw, markers render, badge 0;
  `audit_playability` 0 hard / 0 soft. **Not heard by AI** — no MIDI sent.
- **Found a real bug → NITS:** the conflict badge does **not** recompute when
  you switch scores from a menu. It kept `⚠ 42 soft` from `piece-s16` on a clean
  score until a page reload. Wrong in both directions. Not fixed — the other
  agent is in `composer.html`.

### Composer verdict on phase01: "the shift is far too quick"
- Researched Reich. **The surprise: phase01 was already at Reich's rate.**
  *Drumming* advances one full position in ~20–30 s ≈ 12–18 ms of drift per beat;
  phase01 was 12.5 ms/beat. So "too quick" means **we want to be several times
  slower than Reich**, and the reason is probably resolution — Reich phases a
  stream of 12 semiquavers, we were phasing a bare one-note-per-beat pulse, so
  the ear got very few frames between unison and interlock.
- **The portable dial is drift per attack (ms/beat), not shift duration** — it
  is tempo-invariant. All recipes get written in it. Full write-up, reference
  numbers and the predicted category ladder: **`docs/PHASE_SHIFTING.md`**.

### PHASE02 — the small / medium / large set (100 BPM)
- `phase02-s30` (6.0 ms/beat) · `phase02-m60` (3.0 ms/beat) ·
  `phase02-l120` (1.5 ms/beat) — 2×, 4×, 8× slower than Reich. Only the shift
  duration varies; everything else is pinned.
- **Note length is now a visual: 0.12 s written** (composer's call), against a
  staccato sample that rings ~0.42 s. **This doubles as the probe for an open
  question** — 2n measured where the one-shot *ends itself* but never tested
  whether note-off truncates it (2o asks the same for cuivre). If these sound
  the same as phase01, note-off does not truncate; if they sound clipped, D9
  needs an amendment and variable-length staccato becomes a new dial.
- Each score carries **grey markers at every threshold crossing** (10, 20, 30,
  50, 80, 120, 160, 200, 250, 300 ms), so naming a category is a matter of
  reading the timeline where the sound changes.
- All four phase scores audit **0 hard / 0 soft**.

**Still unheard:** all four phase scores. Everything above about how they sound
is prediction.

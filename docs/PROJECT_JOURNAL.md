# PROJECT JOURNAL — for seven tubas

## §1 Quick-Start

Piece #4 in the lineage; started 2026-08-10 as a detour from piece #3 (which resumes
later). Stack inherited wholesale from #3: composer score (7 instrument-keyed tracks,
`:5200`), sandbox (`:4700`), shared motive library, D8 saving, D9 linked motive blocks.
Deep reference material (sampler quirks, survey playbooks, protocol rationale) lives in
piece #3's `docs/` — registered as an additional working directory.

## §2 Resume Here

**Last session:** *2026-08-11 (day 2, Claude Code) — the calibration day*
- **Independent batch:** Penn State research (**deadline Sept 4, 2026**; 10 parts
  + M1 fits the call) · 10-part expansion + floating META draw window + grain-edit
  suite + Roads env catalog (DB 027) · automation eval (AUTOMATION_EVAL.md; UVI
  deferred-until-bites; tuba 8–10 hardware now UP) · engine framework
  (ENGINE_FRAMEWORK.md: seeded renders, ladder batteries, span test, validated
  tweak analyzer).
- **PASS 2 COMPLETE (live sitting, OC→DH1–DH5):** LAW L4 carved (×2.75 category
  spacing; both-ends saturation; 4 duration categories) · anti-clump machinery
  (maxShortRun, short→mid conversion, run-breaking longs) · **RECIPE MAXDENSE-1
  (DB 035)** · finding 14 (apex-stack loudness) · keeper-excerpt practice.
- **Grain-type pass OPENED (PLAN 2c):** env-catalog regenerated at tier durs
  (0.8/2.2/4.5) · dh5a-pitchfields = unison/chromatic/quartal down one timeline,
  same seed (engine additions: `spec.t0`, `spec.notes`).

**Open at session end (awaiting composer listen):** env-catalog elimination pass
(8 shapes; per-shape tier calibration suspected) · dh5a-pitchfields verdicts
(mass identity off-unison? finding-14 × real intervals) · `surge` naming still
unconfirmed.

**Next up:** grain-type verdicts → envelope-species mix pass (sequence-alternation
hypothesis applies) · four-pass plan pass 3 (least dense — DH2 gap-distribution
hypothesis waits there) + pass 4 (gradations) · level-scatter A/B (finding 13) ·
P3 release-vocabulary session.

**Day 1 (2026-08-10, compressed):** stack seeded from piece #3 · SI2 roster,
dual-port D2 · CC7 law + gain staging calibrated · research arc: laws L1–L3,
Xenakis rules X1–X8, the swell-cloud species (peak-cut = attack) · SC4 dense hold
approved provisional.

**Orientation for a cold session:** RESEARCH_INDEX.md (map) → CURVE_DATABASE.md
(laws L1–L4, entries 001–036, MAXDENSE-1) → ENGINE_FRAMEWORK.md (the method) →
COMPOSER_LOG.md (verbatim). Server: `node score/server.js` (:5200). Score archive
in the Load dropdown.

**Blockers:** none.

## §3 Principles

*(Inherited from piece #3 — full text in its journal §3; they carry verbatim.)*

1. **Check Reaper input monitoring before blaming the instrument.**
2. **When a working reference exists, diff the files — don't iterate guesses.**

## §4 Decisions

- **D1** *(2026-08-10)* — **Inherit piece #3's stack and protocols unchanged.** Score
  app + sandbox copied; #3's **D8** (saving: canonical committed score, explicit-save
  versions capped 20 gitignored, 5 s autosave) and **D9** (motive blocks = linked
  references into `sandbox/motives/`; unlink = fork; fixed per-instrument pitch axis;
  direct on-score editing) apply as written. *Why:* the protocols were designed
  piece-agnostic (engine vs. palette); seven tracks is palette data. Divergences get
  their own D-entries here.
- **D2** *(2026-08-10)* — **21 techniques > 16 channels → each tuba spans TWO UVI
  instances/ports** (`tubaN` = techniques 1–16 on A1–A16 · `tubaNb` = 17–21 on A1–A5;
  composer's build, session 1). Schema extension: a technique's optional `port`
  overrides the instrument port — senders resolve `tech.port || inst.port` (sandbox
  binding + score playback both patched). *Rejected:* UVI port-B via Reaper MIDI bus 2 —
  breaks the clean loopMIDI-port-per-instance wiring. *Slot order = composer's UVI
  screenshots 2026-08-10; keep it identical across all 7 tuba pairs.*
- **D3** *(2026-08-10)* — **Experiment MIDI renders the inferred PERFORMANCE of an
  animated curve, never the curve itself.** The curve is notation (D7 lineage);
  performers track it visually, so renders pass through a performer model (lag,
  smoothing, ~7-level dynamic resolution, eased onsets, anticipation, breath caps,
  per-player jitter — v0 parameters in CRESCENDO_EXPERIMENTS.md, tuned by ear).
  *Why:* curve-literal MIDI would optimize textures no ensemble can play; assessments
  must be of playable renderings. Curve-literal renders remain available as an A/B
  reference only. **Application timing (composer, 2026-08-10): the experiment phase
  runs STRAIGHT curve→sound (curve-literal) to build models first; the performer
  transform gets applied/tested at NOTATION time — "we'll see if the performance
  score curves need to be changed to produce the same sound effect." AI duty: resurface
  this before any performance-score notation is derived from experiment curves.**

- **D3** *(2026-08-10)* — **The mass-texture laws and species live in the research
  docs, with force of decision:** L1 scatter floors / L2 quota trends / L3 keeper
  anchor (CURVE_DATABASE.md) · Xenakis rules X1–X8 (XENAKIS_MASS_RULES.md) · the
  swell-cloud species with peak-cut-as-attack. Engines enforce L1/L2 by default;
  uniform stimuli require explicit override. *(Note: an earlier D3 re performer-model
  rendering also stands — see the experiments doc; renumber on next journal pass.)*

- **D4** *(2026-08-11)* — **Pass-2 outputs carry force of decision:** LAW L4
  (perceptual scale/bluntness, ×2.75 spacing) · RECIPE MAXDENSE-1 (DB 035) is THE
  starting point for max-density passages · keeper-excerpt practice ({score, seed,
  time-range, note}). Fine-tuning happens in-piece against a named target texture,
  not by reopening calibration. *Why:* five listen-cycles converged; the composer
  declared the two parameters well explored.

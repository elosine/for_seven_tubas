# PROJECT JOURNAL — for seven tubas

## §1 Quick-Start

Piece #4 in the lineage; started 2026-08-10 as a detour from piece #3 (which resumes
later). Stack inherited wholesale from #3: composer score (7 instrument-keyed tracks,
`:5200`), sandbox (`:4700`), shared motive library, D8 saving, D9 linked motive blocks.
Deep reference material (sampler quirks, survey playbooks, protocol rationale) lives in
piece #3's `docs/` — registered as an additional working directory.

## §2 Resume Here

**Last session:** *2026-08-10 (session 1, Claude Code)* — **Repo seeded from piece #3.**
- Composer score adapted: 7 tracks labeled Tuba 1–7, canonical score `scores/7tubas.json`,
  port 5200. Sandbox on 4700. `sandbox/instruments.js`: 7 skeleton instruments
  (ports `tuba1`…`tuba7`, placeholder Ordinario ch1, provisional range MIDI 22–65).
- **Library = IRCAM SI2 tuba (0c done): 21 techniques**, transcribed from the composer's
  UVI build into `instruments.js` — real slot lists, dual instances per tuba (D2).
  Rack in progress: `Tuba1 SI2` + `Tuba1b SI2` built; tubas 2–7 = duplicate pairs,
  same slot order, ports `tubaN`/`tubaNb`. Monitoring ON per track — #3 Principle 1.
- **Probe skipped by composer** ("no need") — behaviors learned while composing,
  per-need. Provisional range MIDI 22–65. **Straight to composing: score on :5200.**

**Blockers:** none.

## §3 Principles

*(Inherited from piece #3 — full text in its journal §3; they carry verbatim.)*

1. **Check Reaper input monitoring before blaming the instrument.**
2. **When a working reference exists, diff the files — don't iterate guesses.**

## §4 Decisions

- **D1** *(2026-08-10)* — **Inherit piece #3's stack and protocols unchanged.** Score
  app + sandbox copied; #3's **D8** (saving: canonical committed score, explicit-save
  versions capped 20 gitignored, 5 s autosave) and **D9** (motive blocks = linked
  references into `sandbox/motives/`; unlink = fork; fixed per-instrument pitch axis;
  direct on-score editing) apply as written. *Why:* the protocols were designed
  piece-agnostic (engine vs. palette); seven tracks is palette data. Divergences get
  their own D-entries here.
- **D2** *(2026-08-10)* — **21 techniques > 16 channels → each tuba spans TWO UVI
  instances/ports** (`tubaN` = techniques 1–16 on A1–A16 · `tubaNb` = 17–21 on A1–A5;
  composer's build, session 1). Schema extension: a technique's optional `port`
  overrides the instrument port — senders resolve `tech.port || inst.port` (sandbox
  binding + score playback both patched). *Rejected:* UVI port-B via Reaper MIDI bus 2 —
  breaks the clean loopMIDI-port-per-instance wiring. *Slot order = composer's UVI
  screenshots 2026-08-10; keep it identical across all 7 tuba pairs.*
- **D3** *(2026-08-10)* — **Experiment MIDI renders the inferred PERFORMANCE of an
  animated curve, never the curve itself.** The curve is notation (D7 lineage);
  performers track it visually, so renders pass through a performer model (lag,
  smoothing, ~7-level dynamic resolution, eased onsets, anticipation, breath caps,
  per-player jitter — v0 parameters in CRESCENDO_EXPERIMENTS.md, tuned by ear).
  *Why:* curve-literal MIDI would optimize textures no ensemble can play; assessments
  must be of playable renderings. Curve-literal renders remain available as an A/B
  reference only.
